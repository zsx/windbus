    <summary>D-BUS binding for .NET.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        D-BUS is a message bus system, a simple way for applications
        to talk to one another.
      </para>
      <para>
         The message bus daemon forms the hub of a wheel. Each spoke
         of the wheel is a one-to-one connection to an application
         using libdbus. An application sends a message to the bus
         daemon over its spoke, and the bus daemon forwards the
         message to other connected applications as appropriate. Think
         of the daemon as a router.
      </para>
      <para>
         The bus daemon has multiple instances on a typical
         computer. The first instance is a machine-global singleton,
         that is, a system daemon similar to sendmail or Apache. This
         instance has heavy security restrictions on what messages it
         will accept, and is used for systemwide communication. The
         other instances are created one per user login session. These
         instances allow applications in the user's session to
         communicate with one another.
      </para>
      <para>
         The systemwide and per-user daemons are separate. Normal
         within-session IPC does not involve the systemwide message
         bus process and vice versa.
