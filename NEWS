D-Bus 1.1.1 (18 June 2007)
==
- This is a development release, unless you need specific 
  functionality please use the stable releases as API's may change
  (though we will try hard not to)
- The bus daemon now generates a globally-unique ID for itself, which is available 
  using the convenience function dbus_bus_get_id(). Use this as a unique ID 
  for a user's session, for example.
- dbus_server_get_id(), dbus_connection_get_server_id() now available to access
  the unique ID of a particular address
- dbus_watch_get_fd() deprecated since it had unclear cross-platform semantics.
  dbus_watch_get_unix_fd() and dbus_watch_get_socket() replace it.
- support ANONYMOUS mechanism for authentication, which allows a client to 
  authenticate as nobody in particular
- add API dbus_connection_set_allow_anonymous() which will allow the message
  stream to begin if the client auths as anonymous (otherwise, the client 
  will be dropped unless they auth as a user).
- the ANONYMOUS support means you can now use D-Bus (without a bus daemon) as 
  a protocol for a network service provided to anonymous Internet or LAN  
  clients
- many internal changes to better support the Windows port, though the 
  port is still not complete in this release
- some improved documentation and return_if_fail checks
- some small bug fixes
