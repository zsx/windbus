D-Bus 1.1.0 (25 May 2007)
==
- first release in the development series, unless you need specific 
  functionality please use the stable releases as API's may change
  (though we will try hard not to)
- now works on windows thanks to the hard work of the windows porting team
- better eavesdropping support now picks up reply messages for debugging
- .pc file now lists the directory the daemon is installed into (daemondir)
